# Personalized Monopoly Board Project
This project aims to create a web application that allows users to customize Monopoly boards, with the goal of selling these personalized boards to customers in the future. The project is currently in development, focusing on the logic for board customization.

## Motivation
This project is driven by two main reasons:
Collaborative Idea: It's a joint project conceived with a friend, combining our interests and creativity.
Learning Python: It serves as an excellent opportunity to learn and practice Python programming.

## Project Description
The web application will enable users to design their own Monopoly boards by customizing various elements such as property names, colors, images, and game rules. The key features planned for the project include:
1. User Interface: A user-friendly interface for board customization.
2. Customization Options: Various options for personalizing board elements.
3. Preview Functionality: Real-time preview of the customized board.
4. Order System: A system to place orders for the customized boards (future feature).

## Current Status
The project is still in its early stages. Currently, I am working on the logic for board customization, which involves:
1. Defining the structure of a Monopoly board.
2. Implementing functions to customize different board elements.
3. Creating a basic backend to handle customization logic.

## Technologies Used
Python: For backend logic and customization functionalities.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (planned): For the frontend interface.
